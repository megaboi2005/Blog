        YESSSSSSSS finally, now you can embed videos, images, links, youtube, reddit, insta, and twitter or x just by clicking on any posts share button,
        copying it, then pasting the link in your post (make sure theres a space in between it. For example, "check out my new video www.idk.com/hi.mp4")
        I also updated the rules and will delete any post that breaks those rules. I made a script that can simple purge any post I enter so please don't upload anything rule breaking.
