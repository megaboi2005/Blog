    <h1 style="text-align: center;">2 new subpages this week!!!!!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>As you can see, I have added more the sidebar, as well as the ability to scroll so I can add more to it.</p>

    <h3>WebOS</h3>
    <p>Firstly, I'll start with WebOS. It was a project I made a while back but never made public. I fixed some issues with it, not all of them just some, and released it onto this site.</p>

    <h3>Bored</h3>
    <p>
        Bored is a subdivision of this site for people to post whatever the f*ck they want, as long as you don't break any laws.
        So basically already better than mastodon or insta threads. It loads the latest post made, and it loads up to 10 posts per page.
        Not sure if it breaks internet law because of the lack of a privacy policy, but I swear I am not harvesting your data ;-;. 
        I do not have enough storage on my 45 gb vps to do that anyway. You can input any random name you want per post. Just check out my github in the about page for the source code. 
    </p>

        I should also mention that I have more plans with bored coming down the road. I just wanted to make it as fast as I could before school started lollllll.

    <h4>Enjoy!!!!</h4>
